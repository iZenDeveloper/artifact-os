// Client-side GET coalescer: collapse a burst of identical reads into one
// network request.
//
// Why this exists: many workspace surfaces independently fetch the same read
// endpoint on mount/navigation — the project grid, the recents strip, the
// design-files panel, and every separately-mounted `useWorkspaceContext`
// consumer. Returning to the home view fired ~118 concurrent requests, of which
// the same 8 projects' `/files` appeared 4-6× each and every project's
// `/live-artifacts` twice. With the browser's ~6-connections-per-host cap the
// tail of that burst sat in the connection queue for seconds — measured as
// Σblocked (≈330-494s) an order of magnitude larger than Σserver-wait (≈27-36s).
// The server was not slow; the client simply asked too many times at once.
//
// This helper keys identical in-flight GETs to a single shared promise
// (single-flight, no matter how long the request is queued) and briefly shares
// the settled result, so a mount burst that used to cost N requests costs one.
// It changes no server behavior and is safe only for idempotent display reads
// where sub-second staleness is invisible (covers, thumbnails, the nav shell).
