// Collab realtime — hop-2 (daemon → web) thin invalidation events.
//
// These are SIGNALS, not payloads. An event says only "something of type X
// changed" (plus the scoping id when relevant); the web reacts by RE-FETCHING
// the affected resource through its existing loaders. Never widen these into
// fat payloads — the whole point of the thin model is that a missed event during
// a disconnect is harmless (the reconnect snapshot re-fetch closes the gap), so
// no server-side event buffer / Last-Event-ID replay is required for
// correctness.
//
// Two multiplexed sinks carry these:
//   - Project-scoped events ride the EXISTING `/api/projects/:id/events` SSE
//     alongside `file-changed` / `live_artifact*` / `conversation-created`.
//   - Workspace-scoped events ride the `/api/workspace/events` SSE.
//
// Producer: `apps/daemon` (see `emitProjectEvent` / `emitWorkspaceEvent` in
// `apps/daemon/src/server.ts`). Consumer: `apps/web` (the collab hooks +
// `useEventStream`). One shared type here keeps producer and consumer from
// drifting as the stream grows.
